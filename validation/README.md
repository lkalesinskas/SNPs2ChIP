## Validation -- application of the methods for several examples --

Yosuke Tanigawa (ytanigaw@stanford.edu)

Based on the application examples identified from the team, we apply the methods for several examples, including GWAS hits and ChIP-seq signals.

In the notebook directory, there are seven examples. 

- Asthma_rs4795397.ipynb
- Diabetes_chr6_32408.ipynb
- Diabetes_chr6_32604.ipynb
- VDR_chr10_6390.ipynb
- VDR_chr13_42952.ipynb
- VDR_chr2_33701.ipynb
- VDR_chr5_1315.ipynb

These files are named based on the application area (disease name, such as asthma or diabetes, or biological context like vitamin D receptor, VDR).

For each notebook, we perform the following analysis

- identification of relevant genetic bin
- identification of the relevant latent component with a quantification of degree of contribution
- exploration of the important assays for the component and the results of enrichment analysis
